# PutinOnTheRitz
Putin On The Ritz is a meme given new life in the form of a game. I made this game back in 2014 as a small project to learn the Construct II game engine. It was inspired from the Putin On The Ritz meme as well as games like Flappy Bird and other simple pick up and play games. The goal is simple travel as far as you can as vladimir putin riding a cracker through Russia while jumping obstacles and balancing on your cracker.

Feel free to share this around, remix it, add to it.
